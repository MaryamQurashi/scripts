"""Get and save the 4 lines profile centered at set of point selections.

Given an image with multiple point selections made, gets the horizontal,
vertical, and the two 45 degrees lines profile for each. The data is then
saved into a CVS file, one line profile per column.

Purpose:
    Mutiple point selections were made on the image via some other
    method. The images are transverse plane of centrioles and the
    points correspond to the centriole center. The obtained 4 line
    profile will be later used to measure the diameter.

Target:
    "Saroj Saurya <saroj.saurya@path.ox.ac.uk>" from Jordan Raff lab.
