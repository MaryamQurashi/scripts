Problem
=======

Fiji updater obviously requires write-permission.  This does not plays well
with a multi-user system where one install is to be shared between all the
users.  Removing write permissions means that the updater throws warnings
at the users and that is scary for them.

Solution
========

Drop the jar file created into the Fiji jars directory to disable the
auto-updater.  Run `mvn package` to get the jar file.  kudos to ctrueden.

for details.
